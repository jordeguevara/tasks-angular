# To-Do App

Using Angular 4 and firebase, create an application that will take user input through forms to keep track of items(tasks) and render an interactive UI to toggle with completion of tasks.

The user will be able to create an account with Google+ signin API/FaceBook API, that will authenticate user in order to independently save their tasks.
